<p><strong>“Okay, I’m here, now what?”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Now you get to look around and go shopping of course!</strong></p>
<p><strong>"What… why? How is this different from Vendor Search or NPCs, or player vendors?"</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Magical Stone exchange is a meeting place to allow you to get some extra rewards for your adventuring or event effort!</strong></p>
<p>On each stone available are a unique assortment of items available for purchase with a variety of currencies.</p>
<p>Before I explain all of the stones currently available, I would like to first break into the main currencies used on The New Magincia Magical Stone Exchange Plaza which is broken down in full detail here:&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://wiki.uoalive.com/en/QualityOfLife/currencies</p>
<p>&nbsp;but we will also cover it here for a complete guide!</p>
<h2>Currencies you can spend here:</h2>

  <li>Sovereigns / BritCoin</li>
  <li>Event Tokens</li>
  <li>Powerscrolls</li>
  <li>Iron Ingots</li>
  <li>Gold</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>When it comes to The New Magincia Magical Stone Exchange Plaza, Sovs can be used for a number of things!</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Gold can be used on:</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Gold to Sovereign Exchange</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Currently Sovereigns can be used on the following stones:</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Dyes</li>
  <li>Mounts</li>
  <li>Consumables and Storage</li>
  <li>Decorations</li>
  <li>Transmog Equipment</li>
  <li>Halloween Holiday Stone</li>
  <li>Thanksgiving Holiday Stone</li>
  <li>Christmas Holiday Stone</li>
  <li>Fourth of July Holiday Stone</li>
  <li>And expanding more everyday!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sovereigns were introduced originally via the UO Store on OSI, but have more uses on UOAlive; you can use them to buy items in the UO store, but you can also use them for a number of New Magincia Event Stones.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Okay, but in OSI I had to use real money to buy sovereigns”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Here you acquire you Sovereigns in game and never have to pay a dime to play. This server is 100% a NO DONATION or Pay to Win Server!</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Ways to Acquire Sovereigns:</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>In game:</strong></h3>
<p>Invasions: https://uoalive.com/forum/threads/uoalives-invasions-and-event-tokens-explained.1255/</p>
<p>can award sovereigns based on doing challenges, protecting cities, weekly, monthly, and one off invasion events as well as seasonal! These are a great way of acquiring them!</p>
<h3><strong>Achievements:&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>if you use the command [myachievements, a menu will pop up, the “points” on the achievements menu aren’t just a point of pride, but also will award you “Account Sovereigns” which are simply just normal “Sovereigns” and count toward your overall totals.</p>
<h3><strong>Your Gold can also be exchanged at the Sovereign Exchange Stone</strong></h3>
<p>which will allow you to purchase infinite sovereigns (assuming you have the gold) to be used at the Magincia Market as well as the UO Store.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:295px;"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/D3KeJuh8Sbk3DZB0ROmh1Y8htYw8vQCPKBkT5CZp61t3C_SlfmOI3vaqDR_jcG-nN1M161POoMlEz_bqlPtqSQpM-o4RNCj7oQBGtxjJ5kdgdxrmgiXbLrWDsidkMd3JnN_wMIgJ6QQYh6MjAT-iwLA" alt="D3KeJuh8Sbk3DZB0ROmh1Y8htYw8vQCPKBkT5CZp61t3C_SlfmOI3vaqDR_jcG-nN1M161POoMlEz_bqlPtqSQpM-o4RNCj7oQBGtxjJ5kdgdxrmgiXbLrWDsidkMd3JnN_wMIgJ6QQYh6MjAT-iwLA"></figure>
<h3><strong>BRITCOIN(BTC) is a simple currency</strong></h3>
<p>you acquire it by… being logged into the game. So not unlike real "bitcoin"... spending your electricity by playing UOAlive... who said you COULDN’T mine crypto while playing UO.</p>
<p>So you aquire these just by being logged in and doing anything in the world, but when you log out, why not leave your character hanging out in a "blessed areas", this not only gives you a bonus to BRITCOINS aquired but allows others to marvel at your amazing character standing proud to support UOAlive. This currency will slowly accrue in your bank account, and look like a “Pink” gold pile.</p>
<p>This goes into detail here:&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://wiki.uoalive.com/en/QualityOfLife/currencies</p>
<p>Eventually once you acquire enough BRITCOIN, you can use this to exchange for additional sovereigns!</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:290px;"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/A3FpkZJhOZ231wJtmbcyZewc7RczX6TzkOlD3o31oqpN56d3OSyQ3WPx7n_6pk29U8h8rkF6DikzN6qju0AEYTrhk_EdrZhmusUnQ3u50a3IdU4QrfBxb_Cz1if7PC1Q-79bR757WKHQ5p-wwdb804g" alt="A3FpkZJhOZ231wJtmbcyZewc7RczX6TzkOlD3o31oqpN56d3OSyQ3WPx7n_6pk29U8h8rkF6DikzN6qju0AEYTrhk_EdrZhmusUnQ3u50a3IdU4QrfBxb_Cz1if7PC1Q-79bR757WKHQ5p-wwdb804g"></figure>
<h3><strong>Since this is an MMO of COURSE another source for these is... other players!</strong></h3>
<p>Sovereigns are given to players in a ‘stacked scroll’ form, which allows you to buy and sell these sovereigns to and from other players! You can also withdraw them from your bank!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the vendor search, in game chat, discord, or just running around, you may find an additional source to sovereigns!</p>
<p><span class="text-small">There is one more super secret way to aquire these Sovereigns: Discord Subscription / Patreon Subscription / Occasional Sovereign Sales, while UOAlive is a non-donation or pay to win server, there are still a few “real life” monetary means of supporting the server while acquiring sovereigns in the process.</span></p>
<p><strong>“OKAY, I have SOVEREIGNS, but what now?”</strong></p>
<h3><strong>To purchase any item off an event stone:</strong></h3>
<p>simply go to the stone, double click it, and then click on the desired item. Once you’ve selected it, a metal box will open with the selected item within it, as well as a pop up menu to confirm you desired purchase! Hit “Buy” and the item will be placed in your bag assuming you have the correct currency and amount of said currency.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:584px;"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/xWRQ7PwoiA-qM81OGxhWasBq-ZIPfeJbHdWTc3WtPlLrLkNbyHipL3yIGXPgpj-P_e0a4Ls_SdAUNGKa3iGgrWRyK7F9LJX1ieQcvZ3N0XZOz5DC2zxKo0OR7P87ePAh2Vug8bRfVpdUx48U52n3ZRo" alt="xWRQ7PwoiA-qM81OGxhWasBq-ZIPfeJbHdWTc3WtPlLrLkNbyHipL3yIGXPgpj-P_e0a4Ls_SdAUNGKa3iGgrWRyK7F9LJX1ieQcvZ3N0XZOz5DC2zxKo0OR7P87ePAh2Vug8bRfVpdUx48U52n3ZRo"></figure>
<h2><strong>Event Tokens used to be the main form of currency that was awarded from events, hence the name!</strong></h2>
<p>The event tokens are geared specifically toward the acquisition of <strong>powerscrolls</strong>, and the acquisition of “un-natural” 120 <strong>powerscrolls</strong>, such as 120 Arms Lore (not available on OSI).</p>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Rgc7QGgt1EodSe9qWeCXj9T9r-uYoYoZNdm1M5QJAAooBCgp2G3ZZ4ELNHQAsax6ZYA3eRjENSy9OstXVNSUZ6-IRdqEPUmrDiscIezAmMf-hIo8HDqmVSX4Odgz7_TPFtYPshLdetxYUQcKizDuYgw" alt="Rgc7QGgt1EodSe9qWeCXj9T9r-uYoYoZNdm1M5QJAAooBCgp2G3ZZ4ELNHQAsax6ZYA3eRjENSy9OstXVNSUZ6-IRdqEPUmrDiscIezAmMf-hIo8HDqmVSX4Odgz7_TPFtYPshLdetxYUQcKizDuYgw"></figure>
<p><strong>The available items on the stone:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Random Powerscroll Deeds</li>
  <li>Greater Powerscroll Deeds</li>
</ul>
<p>The Random Powerscroll deed is simply that, a RANDOM 105-120 Powerscroll for 50 event tokens, or you can get a guaranteed SPECIFIC 120 Powerscroll from saving up 2,500 event tokens!</p>
<p><strong>“I don't really like events, I prefer to do my own thing... can I get event tokens in a different way?”</strong></p>
<h3><strong>You must seek, Mr. WHITE the Powerscroll Buyer!</strong></h3>
<figure class="image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/WPeC-QXtqJNrP8GWVRyMo7a9vvKM1jRaiKPI-iRj_y_S9ONVD3mkSfQh8RkIZJveKnlaZ73ZBmvLUK4PZrjx_1XuWObxA0DmGnjOwlz2D5dBAnQr7dcjCxwXC714bbm_XwOZtLcKCQVgp11VzSqL4r8" alt="WPeC-QXtqJNrP8GWVRyMo7a9vvKM1jRaiKPI-iRj_y_S9ONVD3mkSfQh8RkIZJveKnlaZ73ZBmvLUK4PZrjx_1XuWObxA0DmGnjOwlz2D5dBAnQr7dcjCxwXC714bbm_XwOZtLcKCQVgp11VzSqL4r8"></figure>
<p>Mr. White will take all of those ill-gotten powerscroll of your hand and reward you with 5 event tokens per powerscroll!</p>
<p>One of the benefits to UOAlive is that you don’t need to acquire 105-120 powerscrolls in ascending order, you can skip straight to 120 on a given pet or character.</p>
<p><strong>You can read more about Powerscrolls and Champions here: </strong><a href="https://uoalive.com/forum/threads/uoalives-champion-spawns-and-power-scrolls-explained.1283/"><u>Custom Content - UOAlive's Champion Spawns and Power Scrolls Explained</u></a></p>

<p>What this means is that there are going to be a number of powerscrolls that go un-used, which is why Mr. White can be beneficial, he can turn all of those stored 105 and 110 powerscrolls that you aren't using or selling into event tokens!</p>
<h2><strong>The Sea Market Vendor and IRON INGOTS for the Pirates! Yarrrrrr!</strong></h2>
<p><strong>"Iron Ingots... as currency? Really? But WHY!”</strong></p>
<p><strong>UOAlive wanted to make the High Seas content more accessible so they greatly reduced the cost of High Seas equipment and placed it on a convenient "Sea Market Vendor" already crafted for you, you just need to provide the Iron Ingots! Save time, gold, and resources and get yer land lubber some sea legs!</strong></p>
<p><i>Yarrrr! Ahoy there Sailor! If High Seas content be what ye are lookin' fer, then step right up to the Sea Market Vendor! All ye need is some good ol' fashion IRON INGOTS to stock yer vessel to explore Neptunes' Seven Seas! Take part in Sea based adventures without breaking the bank or your back!</i></p>

<p><strong>“Well, WHAT ELSE does the New Magincia Magical Stone Plaza have to offer, this is awesome so far!”</strong></p>
<h1><strong>IDOCS or In Danger of Collapsing Houses</strong></h1>
<p>If picking through others <s>junk&nbsp;</s> treasures is what you seek, but your pockets aren’t deep, then perhaps you would like to try your hand at scavenging other adventurer’s goods! Remember, patience is a virtue, and can also be rewarding!</p>
<p>The newly installed “Housing Assessor” will tell you enough information to get you to hunt high and low for the time old tradition, IDOCs (In Danger of Collapsing Houses).</p>
<p>This handy little device (once double clicked) will spill out valuable information that will tell you whether or not a house is in danger of collapsing, if it’s yellow, that means that there are houses that are greatly worn (less than 30 days left on this realm), or if it’s red, it indicates that there are houses that will be falling within 24 hours!</p>

<h1><strong>Moonstones to Felucca or Trammel</strong></h1>
<p>So you want to travel between facets, but do not want to go to a moongate, and swap, or use recall/gate or chivalry magics to get there?</p>
<p>Well the Magincia Moonstones have got you covered!</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:274px;"><img src="https://uoalive.com/forum/attachments/1675964466439-png.1704/" alt="1675964466439.png"></figure>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:178px;"><img src="https://uoalive.com/forum/attachments/1675964487950-png.1705/" alt="1675964487950.png"></figure>
<p>Free of charge, these relics of a former time, spawn out of the ground and can just be picked up! When you are on the opposite facet, dbl clicking these and planting them into the ground will bring you to the opposite faction in the EXACT same location as where you are standing. So if you are at X Y Z on Trammel and plant a Felucca stone you will get a gate that opens to X Y Z on Felucca! The only acceptation is guarded areas and if there is a house in your way on the other facet!</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:269px;"><img src="https://uoalive.com/forum/attachments/1675964663421-png.1706/" alt="1675964663421.png"></figure>

<p>They are super useful for travel and also surveying for housing and the like!</p>
