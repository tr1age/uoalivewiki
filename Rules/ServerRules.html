<h1 style="text-align:center;"><strong>In-Game Rules</strong>&nbsp;</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;">These rules may differ from the server you come from or if you play on OSI where you pay for a subscription and they do not enforce their own rules. These may appear strict because we dislike actioning people.<br><br>Therefore the rules are here to make sure there are no gray areas.<br><br>These rules ensure a fair and equal gameplay experience for everyone on UOAlive. They also ensure there is a balanced and fair economy as well as equal risk vs reward.<br><br>UOAlive prides itself on a balanced economy and gameplay experience for everyone. These rules are a catalyst.<br><br>Thank you for taking the time to read them.​</p>
<h1><strong>Multi-Boxing or Multi-Clienting</strong></h1>
<p>Playing multiple accounts simultaneously—more commonly known as multi-clienting or multi-boxing—is not permitted on UOAlive.​</p>
<p>You must always be controlling your active Account.*​</p>
<p>No Scripts, No Assistants, No Dual Boxing<i>(keystrokes being used to control multiple Accounts at once from one keyboard or account)</i>, and no automated tasks can be used to "cause damage" to the monsters Account A is fighting from Account B or C.​</p>
<p>The above also applies to beneficial spells, virtue buffs, or general buffs, such as healing pets, players, or friends, casting cures, or using virtues to gain more scrolls.​</p>
<p>The ONLY exception is <u>upon death</u>. Second and third accounts can be utilized to rez or gate or help the first character <u>in case of death</u> or NON combat, progressing, gathering actions or roles, as long as they are swapped to and controlled by the account holder at the time, not done via macros or scripts.​</p>
<p><i><strong>Example</strong>: Account A(and Pet) is fighting a champion spawn, Account B and C cannot be at the same champion spawn to assist Player A(and Pet) in any capacity via a script or macro other than if Account A(and Pet) DIES and is removed from Combat. They can be resurrected, gated, or healed to full to get back to fighting order. Then return to battle without Account B or C assisting in any way. </i>​</p>
<p><i>*It doesn’t matter how many monitors you have and if you can see multiple windows. The window “in focus” and being “used” is the Account you are controlling.</i>​</p>
<p><i>(YOU CAN and ARE ALLOWED to put your extra accounts AFK at a bank or blessed area to benefit from BRITCOIN(BTC) as usual, BRITCOIN is not considered a RESOURCE.)</i>​</p>
<p><i>(YOU CAN and ARE ALLOWED to put macro skills AFK as long as it is not categorized as RESOURCE GATHERING.)</i>​</p>
<p><strong><u>Anything else is considered AFK resource gathering. REFER BELOW to AFK RESOURCE GATHERING RULES:</u></strong></p>
<h1><strong>Resources</strong></h1>
<p>It is <u>against the rules</u> to gather resources with an automated process while you are away from your computer or playing another character. ​</p>
<p>It is <u>not against the rules</u> to gather resources with an automated process while you are controlling your character and not playing any other Account.​</p>
<p>Resources are defined as trees, cotton, ingots, gatherables, fishing, gold, rares, or any other spawned item be it from a “gathering node” or “monster’s corpse”. ​</p>
<p>Failure to respond to a staff member within 2-3 minutes while carrying out these functions will result in punishment.​</p>
<p>BOD collecting AFK is considered AFK resource gathering.​</p>
<p>Fishing AFK is considered AFK resource gathering. <i>(due to the complicated nature of skill gain and afk resource gathering, AFK skill gain of fishing is NOT allowed and is considered AFK resource gathering)</i>​</p>
<p>Killing any NPC, Monster, or Creature over and over AFK is considered AFK resource gathering.​</p>
<p>If you are gaining items in-game, but are AFK, this is AFK resource gathering.​</p>
<p><u>If the game is not fun to you without macros for these things, we ask you to please move on to a different server or game so not to interrupt the fun of others here.</u>​</p>
<p><strong>Example: </strong><i>Account A is resource gathering via scripts, Account B or C is at a champion spawn and being controlled by the player. Account A is no longer being controlled by the player and is considered to be afk resource gathering. It doesn’t matter how many monitors you have and if you can see multiple windows. The window “in focus” and being “used” is the Account you are controlling.</i>​</p>
<h2><strong>Consequences for any of the above:</strong>​</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Your first infraction will result in a 72 hour ban, all items being removed that are considered a resource from your account(ingots, gold, etc), and possible permanent suspension. This will depend on the severity of the offense and will be decided by the admins in a Discord ticket with all members involved. The ban begins after this conversation has concluded even if you are already temporarily banned. If you do not reply within 24 hours of the original in-game “jailing” or temporary suspension, your accounts will be permanently banned. We are not here to waste anyone’s time.</li>
  <li>Your second infraction will result in a PERMANENT BAN of all accounts linked to your IP account. We are no longer giving leniency for this. Obviously you can submit a ticket with an appeal but we record all of these Bans for reference so there is no confusion about "I was just peeing for the entire night".</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>AFK resource macroing ruins servers, economies and player fun. Not only that it wastes the time of the admins and other players who are affected by it. </u></strong>​</p>
<h1><strong>Accounts</strong></h1>
<ul>
  <li>Accounts are limited to 3 accounts per IP with 7 characters per account (House Hold) unless specifically requested.</li>
  <li>1 House per account, total three houses.</li>
  <li>Players creating additional accounts without authorization will have their accounts deleted at to reduce the amount of accounts.</li>
  <li>Accounts are the player’s responsibility: Be sure to register your account. You are responsible for the actions on your account.</li>
  <li>It is not allowed to share your account with anyone else. This can result in a ban. We realize this may seem different than some games, but UO is older and account sharing can lead to exploitation.</li>
  <li>Do not share your account login information or passwords with anyone. This not only breaks our 3 accounts per household rule, but it can put your account at risk.</li>
  <li>Staff will NEVER ask for your password. Do not share it with anyone.</li>
  <li>Your character name should not be offensive, impersonation of staff, or random letters, capitalized crazy, or symbols. It should be a name to keep immersion.</li>
  <li><strong>Accounts over 365 Days of Inactivity are automatically deleted to maintain a fast and efficient server. That means, if you have not logged in to any character on an account 366 days it will be removed. We decided to favor those playing and a smooth experience rather than those who "might" return.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Spouse, family, sign other accounts:</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Open a HELP TICKET on discord to apply for accounts for others of the same household if the accounts will exceed 3. We will happily make an exception and tag your accounts as such.</li>
  <li>You will need to provide proof you live with multiple people playing and pass a few in game tests to have your petition accepted for more than 3 accounts.</li>
  <li>Doing this on your own without opening a ticket can result in temporarily being banned as we keep a log of accounts being shared.</li>
  <li>If we find you exploiting this we will ban all accounts.</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Vendor Markets not inside a home</strong></h1>
<ul>
  <li>There are vendor markets all over the world in Britain, Zento, Magincia and the like.</li>
  <li>You may only have 2 vendors per IP.</li>
  <li>This is the honor system, if we find more we will delete all but 2 at your expense.</li>
  <li>If you need more than 2 vendors you are free to place as many as you wish in the confines of your own player homes without restrictions</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Staff Interaction</strong></h1>
<ul>
  <li>Do not page or ask staff to give handouts or hold events.</li>
  <li>Under no circumstances will staff return lost items. Game play is at your own risk. This includes (but is not limited to) duel pits, vendors and trade.</li>
  <li>Do not page to swear, insult or argue with staff.</li>
  <li>Do not page staff in game to complain about Mechanics that you dislike. There is a suggestions and feedback section on the forums.</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>3rd Party Programs</strong></h1>
<ul>
  <li>Client modifications and cosmetic changes (eg. Treehack) are allowed as long as they do not change the way the client interfaces with the server.</li>
  <li>It is against the rules to distribute client modification, accepting modifications, programs or hacks could put your account at risk to hackers.</li>
  <li>UOSteam, Razor, Razor Enhanced, and Classic Assist are permitted.</li>
</ul>

  <li>You may macro SKILL GAIN within Dungeons, boats, the world, and houses at your own risk.</li>
  <li>There should be no macros for farming monsters automatically, any automated killing, event running, fishing, and “resource gathering”. If you are gaining resources it is Resource Gathering. If you are using pre gathered resources it is not.</li>
  <li>You are not allowed to macro in a blessed area or exploit the fact that there is no damage in these areas to raise skills on yourself or a pet. This is a quality of life addition for those areas, and you are on the honor system. Those found doing so will have their skills wiped. This includes pets.</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Blocking and Traps</strong></h1>
<ul>
  <li>Blocking during combat, with either your character, or another object is considered griefing, unless done by accident, or by a not player mobile. This includes boxing people in with objects.</li>
  <li>It is against the rules to contain a players ghost in such a way that they cannot escape.</li>
  <li>Stamina trapping using your character is not allowed.</li>
  <li>Trapping other players pets in houses or on boats is against the rules as this just causes grief.</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Housing</strong></h1>
<ul>
  <li>It is <strong>illegal </strong>to:</li>
  <li>Use a macro or script to complete any part of the house placement procedure. It must be done entirely by hand.</li>
  <li>Trap an NPC in your house. If the NPC can get in, exits must be available for it to leave.</li>
  <li>It is <strong>legal </strong>to: Trap players within a house. (Use the Leave House Function)</li>
  <li><strong>Houses do decay, but it takes MUCH longer. 90 Days for a house to fully decay if you do not refresh it by opening a door or dbl clicking the house sign within the 90 days.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Boats</strong></h1>
<ul>
  <li>It is legal to:</li>
  <li>To board another’s boat</li>
  <li>To break into a boat hull. Boat Hulls are not secure. Store items here at your own risk.</li>
  <li>Consistent actions like this however will be considered griefing. Please just do the right thing and let others know if their ships are left unsecure.</li>
  <li><strong>Boats do not decay as fast as OSI to give people more fun on the sea! We do not disclose the amount of days a boat can stay at sea, you will need to keep an eye on your boat for decay status. (not everything can be handed to you! hehe)</strong></li>

<h1><strong>Harassment and Spam</strong></h1>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Selling or Buying items in game for Real Life Currency:</strong></h1>
<ul>
  <li><strong>THIS IS 100% against our ToS. We believe players should be enjoying the game within the game not creating a microtransactional sub economy. That is why UOAlive itself is pay to win free. We hope our players adopt this as well. Those found in violation will be immediately removed from the community. There is not "warning" for this violation. Let's keep the GAME fun for everyone!</strong></li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Server</strong></h1>
<ul>
  <li>It is illegal to: Exploit the Server in any way, including Denial of Service, mechanic exploits, unauthorized access to accounts not belonging to you, etc.</li>
  <li>It is against the rules to: Imitate any Staff Members.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Exception to the rules above for Servers:</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>By participating in UOAlive, you agree to not recruit for, or participate in any servers that mimic, imitate, or steal from UOAlive. Any violation of this non-compete clause will result in immediate ban from the game. Please note that this clause does not prohibit playing on other servers, only those that are clearly intended to harm or maliciously smear UOAlive.<br><br><i>To ensure transparency, we want to clarify the server rules regarding player removal. If we detect any issue that violates our rules, we will speak with the player first before taking any action. Unless a violation is illegal, breaks our internal NDA or Policy(which fall under common business practices), intentional acts of malice toward the server, or violates our safe space rules with the intention of harming others, no player will be removed from the server without prior warning. We understand that misunderstandings can happen, so we want to emphasize that players are always given a chance to tell their side of the story, an internal discussion is then had, and if and only if a major infraction has occurred will action be taken.</i><br><br><i><strong>Playing the game positively and being a good influence will never result in removal. Every decision to remove a player is based on our transparent and concise rules.</strong></i></li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Cross Server Recruitment</strong></h1>
<ul>
  <li>Recruiting members to join your server will result in an instant ban and all characters being deleted.</li>
  <li>Bashing UOAlive in a public forum will result in a 24 hour ban and if it continues will result in loss of your accounts.</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>"Claiming" Mobs, Bosses, Areas, Champs, or Events etc.</strong></h1>
<p>Let's officially address this specific point - all players are welcome to participate in world events in UOAlive. Regardless of what the internet says, this is a massive multiplayer game that is always open to everyone. We encourage players to come and go from events as they see fit, including taking on bosses that have just spawned at champs or other group events in the world. It's important to note that no player has a claim to anything in this game simply because of the time they've invested.</p>
<p>While it's polite to ask others to join events, it's not necessary, but highly encouraged in the nature of good sportsmanship and friendly communication. However, in an open-world game like UO, players cannot ask others to leave when fighting monsters. A new player may not even know they are coming up on an event and just want to enjoy the epic adventure in front of them!</p>
<p>Looting rights are given to those who put in the effort, so there should be no issues. In events, prizes usually go directly to the player's pack based on their work, so there is no need to worry about affecting others.</p>
<p>We recognize that end bosses of events can be challenging, and new players will need help. If you feel so inclined and bothered by a new player coming into a champion spawn, you can leave the new players to try the boss on their own. However, new players are always welcome to join, as many may not know what stage the event is at.</p>
<h1><strong>It's important to note that there are common sense exceptions to this inclusivity:</strong></h1>
<p>&nbsp;This rule is intended to make the experience for new players/solo players/small groups of players better. This is not meant for full experienced groups or guilds who just want to take advantage of this section of the server rules. Waiting for someone to open a treasure chest and then stealing all the loot or exploiting event bosses by bringing a large group of people to "overpower the players currently doing the event" when it spawns without helping during the event would be breaking the spirit of UOAlive and the Common Sense rules below.</p>
<p>This rule also does NOT apply to taming. If there is a global announcement of a rare tame, and multiple people go, then it is open season as it is a public announcement, but if you come across someone trying to tame a mob on their own, stealing it or interrupting their tame is against the rules. It all comes down to common sense.</p>
<p>UOAlive is based on trust and community. We aim to foster a friendly atmosphere, so those found exploiting that courtesy will be removed.</p>
<p><strong>-The entire UOAlive Team</strong></p>
<h1><strong>COMMON SENSE GOES INTO A LOT OF UOALIVE'S RULES:</strong></h1>
<p>&nbsp;If you are doing something that gives you an unfair advantage over other players and or hurts the experience or economy of UOAlive, you are breaking a rule. If you ever wonder if you are breaking a rule, feel free to open a ticket and ask us on Discord. We are always happy to clarify. Our intention is NOT to gate you by rules and regulations but to provide a fair and event playing experience for all players new and old on UOAlive.</p>
<p><i>Have you read and agree to these rules? You must now go to our Discord Server and click the green button that says you Agree to the Rules for your permissions and purple name!</i></p>
