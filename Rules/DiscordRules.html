<h1><strong>Discord / Chat Rules</strong></h1>
<p><strong>UOAlive is a Community Public Discord and because of this is moderated to make it a SAFE SPACE environment for all. In the Public Space of UOAlive's discord please try to keep it inclusive, family friendly, and kind. All other chats should be moved to Private Messages or Private Discords.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>No Racism, Sexism, Discrimination, Threats, Harassment or Personal Attacks.</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Discrimination will never be tolerated.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Personal Attacks will not be tolerated. Be polite.</li>
  <li>Cyberbullying is never allowed and is an instant removal.</li>
  <li>Having a different opinion is not an attack.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have ZERO tolerance for any of the above on this discord or others.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Discord PvP</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>We understand dying in game can suck, whatever the circumstances are but under no circumstances are you to go to the discord channel and start venting or threatening those who killed you. That is what the game is for, get revenge there.</li>
  <li>Does that mean you cannot call for help? No feel free to use it as a call to arms, just don't start bragging or yelling at those who killed or you killed.</li>
  <li>Why do you have this rule? Because it never ends well. Ever.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>No Spamming or Advertising.</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>The definition of spam used by this community is determined by the channel staff and is not open to discussion.</li>
  <li>Unsolicited advertising of goods or services is not allowed if it's outside of the realm of the server or game.</li>
  <li>Frequent repetition of the same topic/question is spam. Be patient.</li>
  <li>Do not advertise or bitch about another server in our chat.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>No Flaming, Inciting Hatred or Instigating Arguments.</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>This is a friendly community and as such you are expected to be courteous and follow general chatting etiquette.</li>
  <li>In general, any parties involved in a flame-fest - whether they be the instigator or the flamer, will be dealt with accordingly. The best way to stay out of trouble, with regards to flame-fests, is to not join in.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Constructive Criticism</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>Discord is a more informal method of communication than the forums. When at all possible, questions concerning the forums should be made on the forums. This allows other users not present in Discord to see what was discussed and what the outcome was.</li>
  <li>The staff tries to read and respond to any feedback that is constructive and objective. This does not mean they will change rules/decisions based on the feedback. If a staff member tells you that the decision is made/final continuing to badger them about the reasons is spam. It also means we may miss something.</li>
  <li>It is recommended that any mechanics discussions and bug reports be posted on the forums whenever possible, to allow the rest of the community to weigh in on the subject. Staff will not implement changes based on Discord conversations alone and harassing people for their point of views on a topic is not allowed in Discord.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>No Excessive Use of Profanity.</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>While we have no objection to sharing your opinions and debating a topic - in fact, we encourage it - with other members of this community, we do not tolerate any excessive (directed) profanity whatsoever.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Listen to Staff</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>While the rules will cover most instances, there will be times where something is not specifically covered by the rules. At this time a staff member may tell you to tone down your language or to stop a specific action. Failure to do so may result in the loss of access to Discord.</li>
  <li>Do not PM to swear, insult or argue with staff. We have a suggestions ad feedback and bug reporting forum.</li>
</ul>
