<h1><strong>To see all available commands in game:</strong></h1>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Type [MyCommands</strong></li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>General Server Quality of Life Features</strong></h1>
<ul>
  <li>Resource gathering in all facets is equal. There is no reason to not gather in Felucca or Trammel.</li>
  <li>Enhanced guild system is implemented. Old guildstones still available from gold sink vendor in Zento.</li>
  <li>Skill gain is quick so you get more time to adventure in the world and less time macroing a skill up for a more organic experience.</li>
  <li>Don't worry quick skill gain will not deter your new player experience as this ERA is very item dependent so at 100 skill you will still need good gear to survive!</li>
  <li>Your Health is always 25% more than OSI standards. So if you have 100 str normally you would have 100 health. But on UOAlive you have 125. This benefits PvE to reduce one hits and allow you to last longer in battles while maintaining balance.</li>
  <li>The enhanced client works for updated graphics as well as ClassicUO, Orion, Razor Enhanced, and UOSteam.</li>
  <li>Use our custom Portal System to get to points of interest faster!</li>
</ul>

  <li>Dropping gold coins in your bank box adds them to your account's balance. To pull out gold, use the "withdraw &lt;amount&gt;" command at a bankteller.</li>

  <li>Buying and selling when overweight will cause gold or items to be placed directly in your bank instead of falling to your feet.</li>
  <li>Non-young players can still finish quests in Haven.</li>
  <li>Potions stacks</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>A new New Player Dungeon was created in New Haven<i>(we really want to hammer home the new player experience and make it as educational and accessible as possible!)</i>, this will be an ongoing creation after the patch. No more "mines" as a dungeon. This has wings, progression, and a much more distinct feel to get players used to what they are going to go up against!</li>
  <li>Added more helpful NPCs to roam New Haven that give actual useful information.<i>(Again trying to make that "New Player" experience more immersive, less Google)</i> Scotty finally says helpful shit!</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:292px;"><img src="https://uoalive.com/forum/attachments/1673455578876-png.1460/" alt="1673455578876.png"></figure>

<ul>
  <li>Added NPCs around the world to give it more of the "living breathing world" feel that we always intended but got a little distracted on. Some will even react differently depending on your Karma and other factors. More to come, but good start here.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:650px;"><img src="https://uoalive.com/forum/attachments/crusader2-jpg.1046/" alt="uoalive.com"></figure>
<p>As you know we have been working behind the scenes on all things melee, paladin, archery, and overall just classes that are not sampire or tamer to elevate them up to the right level so players have more choice in how they play on UOAlive.

<p>The Summoner: We have always discussed "pure mages" on UOAlive and the idea that they are not ideal as OSI kinda let them fall to the wayside compared to other builds. But when you combine different skills with them mages and mystics have always been valuable members of any adventuring party...</p>

<p>Those that regularly do crafting and imbuing will find these particularly useful.</p>
<p>There are a range of different boxes available to store categories of items, some are sorted by resource type, others by expansions. Over 12 Total!</p>
<p><strong>All Boxes can be retrieved from Locked Down location in your house, moved to another house, re-secured and will still contain all contents!</strong></p>
<h1><strong>World and expansions</strong></h1>

<h1><strong>PvP</strong></h1>
<ul>
  <li>All worlds are CONSENSUAL PVP ONLY. This means you can participate in guild wars and arena battles but cannot loot or kill unsuspecting players. Even in Guild Wars looting of other players is restricted. It is for the fun of it or RP purposes. Not for loot.</li>
  <li>You can still get the Virtue for killing "reds" by visiting Ocllo and Bucs den, for roaming NPC(non player character) Murderers.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:545px;"><img src="https://uoalive.com/forum/attachments/1675802984292-png.1658/" alt="1675802984292.png"></figure>
<h1><strong>Insurance</strong></h1>
<ul>
  <li>You can insure most important items that are not cursed so if you die they do not fall to your corpse and will be with you upon resurrection.</li>
  <li>If you do lose a body and cannot get to it in time, you can use a corpse collector for a fee in Britain to have it brought to you. You have 1 minute to loot your corpse before his minion literally eats it.</li>
</ul>

<h1><strong>Loot</strong></h1>
<ul>
  <li>All weapons and armor should show a rarity underneath the name.</li>
</ul>

<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:384px;"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/RCULpO8.png" alt="RCULpO8.png"></figure>
<ul>
  <li>There are hundreds of these available for EVERY creature you kill!</li>
  <li>There are rares and stealables all over the server. Nearly 500+ to steal, pickup, or grab on a server restart. Daily rares to custom, there is something for everyone!</li>

<p>Does this image bring back insane NOSTALGIA? If so, you are in the right place. If you are brand new to Ultima Online, this was one of the most coveted rare spawns of Ultima Online in 1997! Players would wake up at crazy hours and rush to the spawn locations of these every server...</p>
<h1><strong>Housing</strong></h1>
<ul>
  <li>House decay timers are 90 days. This means after 90 days of not refreshing a home it will fall and all items can be taken from the ground.</li>
  <li>Monsters and players can enter ALL houses. You can still set doors, gates, and teleporters to friends only. But players and monsters will no longer be kicked from a house for trying to go on the steps. This is a major nuisance when fighting in a town with houses. It is also a major flaw when using houses to fight monsters without fear of them entering.</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Crafting</strong></h1>
<ul>
  <li>Salvage Bags are available for sale from Provisioners.</li>
  <li>Scribes can create Spellbooks and Necromancy Spellbooks, as well as Necromancy scrolls with modifiers. Mysticism books too!</li>
  <li>Custom Plants and Trees along with a robust Flower and Plant Growing system. Cross Breeding, gardening, and more! You can even get "Dungeon Plants and Trees" from certain mobs in game!<br>&nbsp;</li>

<ul>
  <li>There's a sawmill that will cut logs into boards for you.</li>
  <li>Get the BRITCOIN(BTC) bonus here while you craft!</li>
  <li>It also has a Special Forge!</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>BOD system changes</strong></h1>
<ul>
  <li>You can purchase a Bod Box from the gold sink vendor that will fill a Large Bod for you automatically with the needed smalls. All bods still need to be filled with the items. But it skips the step of hunting for all the rare bods.<br><strong>LEARN ABOUT IT HERE: </strong><a href="https://uoalive.com/forum/threads/bod-deed-box-a-solution-to-osis-crappy-bod-system.523/"><u>Custom Content - Bod Deed Box - A solution to OSI's crappy BOD system</u></a></li>

<p>So as we all know, the bod system is a grind from hell and makes it not fun whatsoever. So here is our solution at UOAlive! You can now purchase a Large BOD deed box from the gold vendor in Luna or Britain. It will cost 100k as this is considered an end game item. The Large BOD Deed box is...</p>
<p><strong>Dungeons</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Dungeon chests show the level of the chest in its name.</li>
  <li>In addition to the normal levels 1-4, there is also a level 5 dungeon treasure chest that requires 95 Lockpicking to open.</li>
  <li>All Champion Spawns are RANDOM. This prevents the easy ones from being farmed and destroying the economy.</li>
</ul>

These include: Champion Spawn system (All facets UOAlive only): most of the Power Scrolls can be earned through this system. Blacksmithy and Tailoring: These skill scrolls are earned as...</p>
<h1><strong>Treasure Hunting</strong></h1>
<ul>
  <li>Treasure maps currently use the era-accurate positioning system, but drop the enhanced loot introduced in a later publish.</li>
  <li>Enhancements were made to drops and loot tables.</li>
  <li>Gold from Treasure Chests now drop as bank notes. No more burning through your bag of sending charges!</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Tank wanna-be's...</strong></h1>
<p>Players can now double click any shield and target an enemy they wish to taunt. If the taunt is successful, the enemy will attack the player wielding the shield.</p>
<p><i>Currently, the chance of taunting an enemy is the players parry skill vs the creature's barding difficulty.</i></p>
<p><i>This means that enemies that are bard immune are also taunt immune.</i></p>
<h1><strong>Magincia Stone Exchange And In Game Currencies</strong></h1>
<p>Magical Stones are in Magincia, you can get there via the Moongate's "Special Locations". You can buy all sort of wonders at these!</p>
