<p><i><strong>Things on this list may change or be modified and will be updated accordingly. As well more will be added to the list as they come to mind or we add them.</strong></i></p>
<h1><strong>To see all available commands in game:</strong></h1>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Type [MyCommands</strong></li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>General Server Quality of Life Features</strong></h1>
<ul>
  <li>Resource gathering in all facets is equal. There is no reason to not gather in Felucca or Trammel.</li>
  <li>Enhanced guild system is implemented. Old guildstones still available from gold sink vendor in Zento.</li>
  <li>Skill gain is quick so you get more time to adventure in the world and less time macroing a skill up for a more organic experience.</li>
  <li>Don't worry quick skill gain will not deter your new player experience as this ERA is very item dependent so at 100 skill you will still need good gear to survive!</li>
  <li>Your Health is always 25% more than OSI standards. So if you have 100 str normally you would have 100 health. But on UOAlive you have 125. This benefits PvE to reduce one hits and allow you to last longer in battles while maintaining balance.</li>
  <li>The enhanced client works for updated graphics as well as ClassicUO, Orion, Razor Enhanced, and UOSteam.</li>
  <li>Use our custom Portal System to get to points of interest faster!</li>
</ul>

  <li>Dropping gold coins in your bank box adds them to your account's balance. To pull out gold, use the "withdraw &lt;amount&gt;" command at a bankteller.</li>

  <li>Buying and selling when overweight will cause gold or items to be placed directly in your bank instead of falling to your feet.</li>
  <li>Non-young players can still finish quests in Haven.</li>
  <li>Potions stacks</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>A new New Player Dungeon was created in New Haven<i>(we really want to hammer home the new player experience and make it as educational and accessible as possible!)</i>, this will be an ongoing creation after the patch. No more "mines" as a dungeon. This has wings, progression, and a much more distinct feel to get players used to what they are going to go up against!</li>
  <li>Added more helpful NPCs to roam New Haven that give actual useful information.<i>(Again trying to make that "New Player" experience more immersive, less Google)</i> Scotty finally says helpful shit!</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:292px;"><img src="https://uoalive.com/forum/attachments/1673455578876-png.1460/" alt="1673455578876.png"></figure>

<ul>
  <li>Added NPCs around the world to give it more of the "living breathing world" feel that we always intended but got a little distracted on. Some will even react differently depending on your Karma and other factors. More to come, but good start here.<br>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:650px;"><img src="https://uoalive.com/forum/attachments/crusader2-jpg.1046/" alt="uoalive.com"></figure>
<p>As you know we have been working behind the scenes on all things melee, paladin, archery, and overall just classes that are not sampire or tamer to elevate them up to the right level so players have more choice in how they play on UOAlive.

<p>The Summoner: We have always discussed "pure mages" on UOAlive and the idea that they are not ideal as OSI kinda let them fall to the wayside compared to other builds.

<h1><strong>PvP</strong></h1>
<ul>
  <li>All worlds are CONSENSUAL PVP ONLY. This means you can participate in guild wars and arena battles but cannot loot or kill unsuspecting players. Even in Guild Wars looting of other players is restricted. It is for the fun of it or RP purposes. Not for loot.</li>

</ul>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:545px;"><img src="https://uoalive.com/forum/attachments/1675802984292-png.1658/" alt="1675802984292.png"></figure>
<h1><strong>Insurance</strong></h1>
<ul>
  <li>You can insure most important items that are not cursed so if you die they do not fall to your corpse and will be with you upon resurrection.</li>
  <li>If you do lose a body and cannot get to it in time, you can use a corpse collector for a fee in Britain to have it brought to you. You have 1 minute to loot your corpse before his minion literally eats it.</li>
</ul>

<h1><strong>Housing</strong></h1>
<ul>
  <li>House decay timers are 90 days. This means after 90 days of not refreshing a home it will fall and all items can be taken from the ground.</li>
  <li>Monsters and players can enter ALL houses. You can still set doors, gates, and teleporters to friends only. But players and monsters will no longer be kicked from a house for trying to go on the steps. This is a major nuisance when fighting in a town with houses. It is also a major flaw when using houses to fight monsters without fear of them entering.</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Crafting</strong></h1>
<ul>
  <li>Salvage Bags are available for sale from Provisioners.</li>
  <li>Scribes can create Spellbooks and Necromancy Spellbooks, as well as Necromancy scrolls with modifiers. Mysticism books too!</li>

<h1><strong>BOD system changes</strong></h1>
<ul>
  <li>You can purchase a Bod Box from the gold sink vendor that will fill a Large Bod for you automatically with the needed smalls. All bods still need to be filled with the items. But it skips the step of hunting for all the rare bods.<br><strong>LEARN ABOUT IT HERE: </strong><a href="https://uoalive.com/forum/threads/bod-deed-box-a-solution-to-osis-crappy-bod-system.523/"><u>Custom Content - Bod Deed Box - A solution to OSI's crappy BOD system</u></a></li>

  <li>Enhancements were made to drops and loot tables.</li>
  <li>Gold from Treasure Chests now drop as bank notes. No more burning through your bag of sending charges!</li>
</ul>
<h1><strong>Tank wanna-be's...</strong></h1>
<p>Players can now double click any shield and target an enemy they wish to taunt. If the taunt is successful, the enemy will attack the player wielding the shield.</p>
<p><i>Currently, the chance of taunting an enemy is the players parry skill vs the creature's barding difficulty.</i></p>
<p><i>This means that enemies that are bard immune are also taunt immune.</i></p>
<h1><strong>Magincia Stone Exchange And In Game Currencies</strong></h1>
<p>Magical Stones are in Magincia, you can get there via the Moongate's "Special Locations". You can buy all sort of wonders at these!</p>
